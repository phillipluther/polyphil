== Description ==

This is a personal theme for my blog and podcast site. Goals of the project included 1) goofing around with custom themes, 2) trying to make something minimalistic, mobile-friendly and uncluttered, and 3) playing around with WP plugins after being away from the platform for a long while ... which seem to be as bossy and badly-designed as I remember.

It is by no means a "complete" theme; I built the thing to serve the specific needs I had in standing up a WP installation and making it look the way I wanted, including and creating only the pages and styles I had use for.

It probably touches 0.1938% of what's in the Wordpress Codex. But, hey ... that Codex is insane.

The theme code itself is hosted at Github:

== NodeJS/Gulp Usage ==

I put together some bare-bones Gulp tasks for working with the .less files and helping out with development and checked in the assets for version control so I wouldn't have to manually port stuff around. 

It clutters up the theme folder. Meh.


== Plugins Utilized ===

The following plugins are expected by the theme and include custom styling in the final build:

* AddToAny Share Buttons
* Thumbs Rating
* wpDiscuz - Supercharged native comments
* ... to be fleshed out ...


== Changelog ==

* Latest: November 16, 2015

Major overhaul of the theme, including more customized pages following the WP get_template_part() conventions and adding more robust search/404 handling. New custom pages for Blog and Podcast display, fancy responsiveness now baked in.
